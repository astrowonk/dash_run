## Dash GPX Run Analysis

This is the source code to my [Dash app](https://dash.plotly.com) that processes gpx workout files and produces a GPS-based pace/distance information. It is powered by [gpxrun](https://github.com/astrowonk/gpxrun) and [gpxcsv](https://github.com/astrowonk/gpxcsv).

It is [deployed and running on my website](https://marcoshuerta.com/gpxrun/).
